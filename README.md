## Overview

I just created new UIKit document based project for from Xcode 13, and I realized that created project is not for multiple windows / scene delegate support.
I thought it might be a good idea for making a plain iPad document based Xcode project.

First of all, I just finish up this project as a plain text editor.  At this moment, this project only supports a single window.

Then, I made some changes to make this project to support multiple windows and scene delegate, so that you can work on two documents side by side on iPad.
